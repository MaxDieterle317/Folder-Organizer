# Folder-Organizer
This Python script automatically organizes files in your Downloads folder by moving them into categorized folders based on their file type (such as images, documents, music, etc.). It uses a configuration file (config.json) to define which file extensions belong to which categories and where each category should be moedv. When you run the script, it scans the Downloads folder, checks each file's extension, and moves it to the matching destination folder (like moving .jpg files to your Pictures folder). It also avoids overwriting files by renaming duplicates. You can run the script in "dry-run" mode to preview what would happen without actually moving any files, which is great for testing. All activity is logged in a file called organizer.log so you can track what the script has done. This tool is helpful for keeping your computer tidy without having to sort files manually.

To use this program on your computer, make sure you have Python 3 installed. Clone/download this repository, and update the JSON file with the correct paths for your own Downloads folder and destination folders (e.g., for images, documents, etc.). Then, run the Python script using a terminal or command prompt. The script will automatically move files from your Downloads folder into categorized folders based on file type. You can customize the file type categories and extensions in the JSON file to fit your needs.
